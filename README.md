In this project, I focused on cleaning and preparing COVID-19 death and vaccination data for analysis. Through exploratory data analysis using SQL, I gained insights into the dataset. I further visualized the data using Tableau (link available in bio), identifying trends and making informed predictions. Additionally, I conducted an in-depth investigation into the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality, contributing valuable findings for public health assessment.
